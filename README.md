### Config

Heres the current config from the v2.1.1 version:

    /* CONFIG */
    var loopTimeStart = 1; // How many minutes it'll take for autom1ner to loop.
    var verbose = true; // Debug messages, recommended on but can cause clutter.
    var minimumAmount = 0; // how much energy/dominance you want before you click the buttons
    var minifie = false; // removes elements from the screen that isn't required (can save resources)
    /* CONFIG END */
